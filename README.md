## Ebooks available for learning


All topics are classified according to learning needs. You can find books for beginners or experts. I believe in the need to share best practices and sources of knowledge to improve skills. The world of embedded systems, microcontrollers since 2010 is open to the general public with the arrival of electronic prototyping boards like Arduino, Raspberry Pi. It is a playground for hackers, so be free to share and clone this repository.

## Sources

The ebooks available were all retrieved from the internet. Other sites share it and a simple Google search by PDF specifying the name of the book allows it to be downloaded.

## Get books


If your are new on github install Git and learn how to clone the repository. So find your terminal or shell and download the repository by this command line
```bash
git clone https://github.com/legoffant/learnprogramming.git
```

Remind to have 2go available on hardisk to download more of 200 books

## Roadmap

Where to start? If you are a complete beginner, I advise you to read Eric Raymond's article on hacking:

* [How to Become a hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)

Then move on topic like:

1. System programming, pointer in C and arduino
2. OOP (Object oriented programming) in C++
3. Shell and python scripting
4. Learn Vim while programming for all task(forget IDE)
5. Git and version control
6. Linux for hackers
7. Build a lab with VM's and board like Beaglebone black on your network
8. Safe hack
9. Data structure and algorithm
10. Design pattern
11. Data vizualization

## Contribute

This library may need more reference, if you want to participate don't hesitate to fork this repository and create your branch with your potential additions. Follow this document for more details if this is your first Pull Request (PR) on Github. Any help is welcome.

## The vision

My temperament is to seek breakthrough innovation in industry and technology. I look to the stars on long term projects such as asteroid mining possibilities. This industry will be fully robotic with drones. For the moment, only the Boeing x-37 has space drone capabilities. But in the future the needs of drones in the air for freight will be the start of space drones. Major on-board system projects are therefore awaiting some innovations as well as inventions of a new propellant as well as of system architecture. The opportunity is to develop a fully open source space industry with a focus on freight.This library provides the necessary ammunition with little to train you on on-board systems and drones.
