## Ebooks available for learning


All topics are classified according to learning needs. You can find books for beginners or experts. I believe in the need to share best practices and sources of knowledge to improve skills. The world of embedded systems, microcontrollers since 2010 is open to the general public with the arrival of electronic prototyping boards like Arduino, Raspberry Pi. It is a playground for hackers, so be free to share and clone this repository.

## Sources

The ebooks available were all retrieved from the internet. Other sites share it and a simple Google search by PDF specifying the name of the book allows it to be downloaded.

## Get books


If your are new on github install Git and learn how to clone the repository. So find your terminal or shell and download the repository by this command line
```bash
git clone https://github.com/legoffant/learnprogramming.git
```

Remind to have 2go available on hardisk to download more of 200 books

## Roadmap

Where to start? If you are a complete beginner, I advise you to read Eric Raymond's article on hacking:

* [How to Become a hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)

Then move on topic like:

1. System programming, pointer in C and arduino
2. OOP (Object oriented programming) in C++
3. Shell and python scripting
4. Learn Vim while programming for all task(forget IDE)
5. Git and version control
6. Linux for hackers
7. Build a lab with VM's and board like Beaglebone black on your network
8. Safe hack
9. Data structure and algorithm
10. Design pattern
11. Data vizualization
